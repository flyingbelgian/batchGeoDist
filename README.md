# batchGeoDist
Batch calculate geological distances

Takes 2 files (to be selected by user through OS file selection prompt):
- first file has reference points
- second file has points which are to be measured against reference points

The script prompts user to select the required reference points from the first file and generates a csv with all the measurements listed out.
